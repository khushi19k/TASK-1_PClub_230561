#Problem Statement:
Calculate the value of the a^a^a^.^.(that is, where the exponentiation is performed n-1 times on a) modulo 1000000007.
#Input:
The first line contains a single integer t(1<=t<=10^6)-- the number of test cases.
Each of the next t lines contains two integers a(1<=a<=10^9) and n(1<=n<=10^6).
#Output:
For each test case, print a single integer --- the result of the computation modulo 1000000007.
